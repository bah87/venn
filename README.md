# README


Venn is a Facebook-inspired social media app. It's a place to share, network and
collaborate. Connect with friends and family, or go out on a limb and meet new people!

## Technologies
  * Venn uses a PostgreSQL database to store user info, posts and comments, while
    Amazon Web Services is used to store images uploaded by users. Venn uses a
    Rails backend to store, retrieve, or remove data from the PostgreSQL DB. The frontend
    views use React, while Redux is used for state management.

## Features and Implementation
  * One of the key features of Venn is the ability to upload new photos.
  The post form allows users to preview images they upload and select a new one
  before posting. Users can also add, update, or delete images from posts after
  they've been created. If you made edits to a post and then decide you want to
  leave them unchanged, you can cancel the edit post form and your post will remain
  untouched.
